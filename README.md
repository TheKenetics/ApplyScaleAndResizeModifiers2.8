## Using
1. Run the operator from...
* 3D View > Apply Menu (Ctrl + A) > Apply Scale and Resize Modifiers  
* Operator Search > Apply Scale and Resize Modifiers  
2. The operator will resize the selected objects' modifiers and apply scale.
3. Change Resize Source to get a possibly better result if the object's scale is not uniform.

## Notes
Works best with objects that have uniform scale. If scale isn't uniform, use Resize Source to get a possibly better result.

Automatically copies datablocks if they have multiple users.

Array modifier's Constant Offset can use non-uniform scale.
